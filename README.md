# One-For-All
Your one stop extension for VSCode to make searching the web easier.

# What it does:
Well, if you are stuck in some confusion about what this code does or what this function does, then you can simply highlight that line of code and you'll get instant search results for that query on your default web-browser without having to leave your IDE.

## How it works!
Simply select the word or function you want to search, then right click and hover over `Search` in drop-down menu. This will then give you options for several search engine browsers to look up from.
